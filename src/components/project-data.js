In this time we\'ve climbed up google rankings, and I\'ve built out features that have addressed various lead generating efforts.</p><h4>Features</h4><p>Theme Framework: The theme is a responsive framework called Chassis that I spearheaded the creation of during my time at Staffing Robot (the business was later aquired by Advanced). The theme framework was designed to be used again and again with different clients. It features <a href="http://getbem.com/" target="_blank" >BEM naming conventions</a>, a set of bootstrap-like shortcodes that can be customized per client, and an architecture that aligned with the <a href="http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/" target="_blank" >Brad Frost\'s atomic design principals</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.advancedtravelnursing.com/nursing-events-calendar/" target="_blank" >Events:</a> The client wanted to create a community around the temps they placed, so we created a feature in the form of an events plugin. I kicked off development of this plugin with the excellent <a href="https://wppb.me/" target="_blank" >Wordpress Plugin Boilerplate Generator</a> and then customized from there. It\'s a custom post type that utilizes the <a href="https://github.com/kylestetz/CLNDR" target="_blank" >clndr js plugin</a> to render the UI.</p><p><a href="https://www.advancedtravelnursing.com/recruiter-pages" target="_blank" >Recruiter Pages:</a> Rockstar recruiters are granted "recruiter pages". These serve as a promotional tool and a way to foster a connection between nurses and their recruiters. Nurses can give feedback via a Gravity Forms feedback form, then approved feedback is displayed in a slider of users, their reviews, and ratings.</p>',

In addition to these we spec\'d out some gated content apps that we could use as a lead generating mechanism on the site.</p><p>I also developed a lead generating "state salary info" widget. This piece of content captures a lead and then sends that lead an email that has links to different state resource pages on the Advanced Therapy site.</p>',

We worked with business leaders in the community in Oregon and Washington to address their stress points in their very new and unusual industry. </p><p><strong>Development:</strong> The build centers around three great codebases (WP Job Manager, Roots Sage, and Bootstrap) I chose because their object oriented structure allowed me to customize this product quickly, without work-arounds. Our job board build features employer and job seeker dashboards, sortable lists of applicants for employers, and quick apply sliders so job seekers can show off their skills quickly and easily.</p><p><strong>Design:</strong> We chose early on to limit the numbers of photos on the site and to minimize the pot references. I felt that this approach would allow any person to imagine themself a user, and play down any cutural stigma that weed has had in the past. The new cannabis industry includes scientists, entrepaneurs, farmers, and political activists as well as pot enthusiasts. Our goal was to send design trust signals and keep the appearance open to all and not too stoney.</p>',
